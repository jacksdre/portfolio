### About Me

I am a student at The Ohio State University and a I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I am currently employed by Mars Petcare and head the Inventory Control team at the largest pet food manufacturing facility in North America. The amount of data, analysis, and work with databases that this job demands had me questioning ways that software could improve job processes and started my interest in software development.  

## Experience

Through my course work at OSU I have developed working ability in C++, Java, and Swift. Outside of normal course work I am working on a certificate course for app development with Swift. I was new to the language and app development in general but have since completed the first 3 chapters of Apples App Development with Swift book along with all labs. With this experience I have learned the fundementals of the Swift language. How to build basic apps with the UIKit in Xcode and how to make a user friendly experience with the principles outlined in Apples iOS Human Interface Guidelines.
